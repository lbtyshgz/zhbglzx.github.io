10.好行为...134 -156


p134
离开对好行为深入的讨论，律法和福音的描述就是不完全的。 
No presentation of law and gospel is complete without a thorough discussion of 
good works. 
每一个宗教都教导一些关于好行为的事。每一个非基督教的宗教都完全建立
在好行为的理念上，并将它作为得救的途径。对好行为的教导，是路德宗和罗马
天主教神学核心的差异。天主教经常指责路德宗并不教导，甚至鄙视好行为。 
Every religion teaches something about good works. Every non-Christian 
religion is built completely upon the idea of works as the way to salvation. Teachings 
about good works get to the very heart of the differences between Lutheran and 
Roman Catholic theology. Catholics often fault Lutherans for not teaching—even for 
despising—good works. 
在改革宗（非路德宗的新教）教会和路德宗教会之间，教导和鼓励好行为的
方式，存在着显著的差异。有些时候这差异是如此的微妙，以至于不知情的路德
宗信徒没有意识到这种关键的差别。他们可能辩称，如果差异如此微妙，那就不
会产生太大影响。但是同样的人是否会同意，如果一个医学专家告诉他，在某些
重要器官里的癌症只有一点点，所以不需要为之担心。 
There is a distinct difference between the way Reformed (non-Lutheran 
Protestant) churches and Lutheran churches teach and encourage good works. 
Sometimes the difference is so subtle that uninformed Lutherans fail to note the 
critical difference. They may reason that if the difference is that subtle, it can’t be of 
much consequence. But would the same person stand for it if a medical expert told 
him or her the cancer in some vital organ is a little one, so don’t worry about it? 
好行为！一个人怎么相信和教导好行为，是正确区别律法和福音的关键之所
在。再次地，我们不要依赖感觉和情绪，也不要倾听流行的意见，而是转向圣经，
并仔细聆听它在说什么，这对于我们至关重要。 
Good works! What one believes and teaches about good works gets to the very 
heart of the proper distinction between law and gospel. Again, it is vital that we do 
134 
not rely upon feelings and emotions or listen to majority opinions, but turn to Holy 
Scripture and listen carefully to what it says. 
好行为是有价值的Good	works	are	valuable	
好行为的观念，按照它本身，并不是消极的，它完全是积极的。圣经充满了
对基督徒去做好行为的鼓励。回想使徒保罗的话。对加拉太人他写道：“我们行
善不可丧志……一有机会就要向众人行善，向信徒一家的人更要这样”（加
6:9,10）。保罗劝勉提摩太，“又要嘱咐他们行善，在好事上富足，甘心施舍，
乐意分享”（提前6:18）。他劝勉提多教导基督徒，“使那些已信上帝的人留心
行善”（多3:8）。 
The idea of good works, in and of itself, is not negative; it is wholly positive. 
Scripture is replete with encouragement to Christians to do good works. Recall some 
words of Saint Paul. To the Galatians he wrote: “Let us not become weary in doing 
good . . . let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of 
believers” (Galatians 6:9,10). Paul advised Timothy, “Command them to do good, to 
be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share” (1 Timothy 6:18). He 
advised Titus to teach Christians to “devote themselves to doing what is good” (Titus 
3:8). 
我们救主的登山宝训（太5-7），对基督徒成圣的生命，是一个卓越的指引。
耶稣全部的生命和事工，比如他风餐露宿的教导人们，帮助那些被带到他那里的
人，对于基督徒，是接连不断的榜样。 
Our Savior’s Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7) is an excellent guide for 
Christians in their lives of sanctification. Jesus’ entire life and ministry is one example 
after another for Christians, as he went about teaching the people and helping those 
who were brought to him. 
好行为是有价值的重要原因是，它们符合上帝的旨意。在他圣洁的律法里，
上帝揭露了他对人们生命的旨意。虽然律法首先和主要的功能是使罪人承认他们
需要一位救主，律法对基督徒同样起着指导的作用（见第九章）。 
Good works are valuable for the very reason that they conform to the will of 
God. In his holy law God has revealed his will for people’s lives. While the first and 
135 
chief function of the law is to convince sinners of their need for a Savior, the law also 
serves as a guide for the Christian (see Chapter 9). 
由于好行为符合上帝的旨意，好行为同样用于荣耀上帝。耶稣提醒那些相信
他的人，他们是世上的光，并且他督促道，“你们的光也要这样照在人前，叫他
们看见你们的好行为，把荣耀归给你们在天上的父”（太5:16）。 
Inasmuch as doing good works conforms to the will of God, good works also 
serve to glorify God. Jesus reminds those who believe in him that they are the light 
of the world and urges, “Let your light shine before men, that they may see your 
good deeds and praise your Father in heaven” (Matthew 5:16). 
好行为是有价值的，因为它们事实上是上帝在基督徒里面，并透过基督徒的
工作。在这一章接下来的部分我们会更多的谈论这个话题。现在，我们可以说，
如果好行为是上帝在我们里面的工作，好行为必须被视为有价值的。任何上帝的
工作，都不可能是坏的，也不能被人冷漠的对待。 
Good works are valuable because they are actually God working in and through 
the Christian. We shall say more about this later in this chapter. For now, may it be 
enough to say that if good works are God’s work in us, they must be considered 
valuable. Nothing that God works can be bad or regarded indifferently. 
好行为是有价值的，同样因为它们证明了称义，即，它们为一个已经透过信
心接受了上帝公义宣判的人，提供了证据。路德正确的理解称义为首要的信条。
这是福音的核心。唯独它决定了我的拯救。罪人透过基督珍贵的功德被称为义。
借着耶稣的生命和复活，上帝宣称罪人为义（罗 5:18,19），透过信心，耶稣的
公义成为我的公义（罗5:1）。这就是我称义的故事。好行为证明或见证了我的
称义。在我的生命中为我的称义作证的东西，必定是有价值的。再次地，我们在
这章随后的部分会更详细的说明。 
Good works are valuable also because they prove justification, that is, they give 
evidence that a person has received God’s verdict of justification through faith. 
Lutherans rightly consider justification to be the chief article of faith. It is the very 
heart of the gospel. It alone determines my salvation. Sinners are justified through 
the precious merits of Christ. Through Jesus’ life and resurrection, God has declared 
sinners justified (Romans 5:18,19), and Jesus’ righteousness becomes mine through 
136 
faith (Romans 5:1). That is the story of my justification. Good works prove or give 
evidence of my justification. What proves justification in my life must be valuable. 
Again, we’ll say more of this later in the chapter. 
从奖赏的角度来看，好行为同样是有价值的。上帝应许奖赏好行为：“我们
行善不可丧志，因为若不灰心，到了适当的时候就有收成”（加6:9）；“你们
无论做什么，都要从心里做，像是为主做的，不是为人做的；因为你们知道，从
主那里必得着基业作为赏赐。你们要服侍的是主基督”（西3:23,24）。 
Good works are also valuable from the viewpoint of reward. God promises to 
reward good works: “Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time 
we will reap a harvest if we do not give up” (Galatians 6:9); “Whatever you do, work 
at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men, since you know that 
you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are 
serving” (Colossians 3:23,24). 
上帝对信徒行为的奖赏，是今生和永生的祝福。当耶稣的门徒想知道，上帝
为那些跟随他的人预备了什么时，耶稣向他们保证，“凡为我的名撇下房屋，或
是兄弟、姊妹、父亲、母亲、儿女、田地的，将得着百倍，并且承受永生”（太
19:29）。使徒保罗同样说到：“因操练身体有些益处；但敬虔在各方面都有益，
它有现今和未来的生命的应许”（提前4:8）。 
God’s reward to believers for the works that they do is both temporal and 
eternal. When Jesus’ disciples wondered what was in store for them for following 
him, Jesus reassured them, “Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or 
father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as 
much and will inherit eternal life” (Matthew 19:29). The apostle Paul says the same: 
“Physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding 
promise for both the present life and the life to come” (1 Timothy 4:8). 
上帝应许给信心和好行为的奖赏并不是我们挣得的奖赏。也不是说，基督徒
可以在他的行为上寻找或要求奖赏。我们在本章随后的部分会谈到，基督徒的好
行为从未完全。离开圣灵的工作和影响，好行为不可能存在。基督徒获得的任何
奖赏，无论是今生的还是来生的，都是恩典的奖赏。 
137 
The rewards that God promises for faith and good works are not earned 
rewards. Nor could a Christian ever seek or demand a reward for his works. We will 
note later in this chapter that the good works of the Christian are never perfect. 
Without the work and influence of the Holy Spirit, good works would be nonexistent. 
Any rewards the Christian receives, temporal or eternal, are rewards of grace. 
在耶稣关于工人和葡萄园的比喻中，人们在一天中的任何时刻进入葡萄园工
作，一些很早，一些在离开前的一个小时。到了付钱的时候，园主给了每个人一
个银币。所有人都得到了相同的工钱。当那些工作了一整天的人开始抱怨，园主
回答说，“难道我的东西不可随我的意思用吗？因为我作好人，你就眼红了吗？”
（太20:15）。在上帝的葡萄园——教会，也是这样，上帝依照他的恩典奖赏人。
信徒获得的任何奖赏，无论是今生的还是来生的，都是不配有的。基督徒不怀有
任何功德，唯独感激于一个亲切仁慈的上帝，他不会让我这样的罪人死亡。 
In Jesus’ parable of the workers and the vineyard, men entered the vineyard to 
work at all times of the day, some early, some an hour before quitting time. When it 
came time to pay, the owner gave each one a denarius. All received the same pay. 
When those who had labored all day began to complain, the owner replied, “Don’t I 
have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I 
am generous?” (Matthew 20:15). So also in God’s vineyard, the church, God rewards 
according to his grace. Any reward the believer receives, temporal or eternal, is 
undeserved. The Christian entertains no idea of merit, only gratitude to a gracious 
and merciful God, who would not let this sinner die. 
好行为是必须的Good	works	are	necessary	
好行为不仅是有价值的，我们也可以说，好行为是必须的。这是路德宗基督
徒应该格外谨慎的地方。好行为是必须的？圣经不是说罪人唯独因信得救，不在
乎行为吗？如果我们谈论的是称义，“好行为是必须的”就是一个异教的陈述。
圣保罗坚称：“所以我们认定，人称义是因着信，不在于律法的行为”（罗3:28）。
但是，当我们谈论成圣，作为称义的结果，我们可以说——我们也必须说——好
行为是必须的。 
138 
Good works are not only valuable; we may also say that good works are 
necessary. This is where the Lutheran Christian may become wary. Good works are 
necessary? Doesn’t the Bible say that the sinner is saved by faith alone, without 
works? If we are talking about justification, “good works are necessary” is a heretical 
statement. Saint Paul’s words stand: “For we maintain that a man is justified by faith 
apart from observing the law” (Romans 3:28). But, when we are speaking of 
sanctification, which is the result of justification, we may say—we must say—that 
good works are necessary. 
当雅各写到，“我的弟兄们，若有人说自己有信心，却没有行为，有什么益
处呢？这信心能救他吗？……信心也是这样，若没有行为是死的”（雅2:14,17），
他并没有和保罗产生冲突。雅各谈论的是成圣，它随着信心而来，作为信心的见
证。 
James is not in conflict with Paul when James writes, “What good is it, my 
brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? . . . Faith by itself, if it is not 
accompanied by action, is dead” (James 2:14,17). James is talking about 
sanctification, which follows faith as a proof of faith. 
信心是关乎心灵的事。任何人都可以轻易地说“我是一个基督徒”，或“我
有信心”。一个人可以这样说，却仍然是个不信者。这样的人是假冒伪善者。但
是，雅各坚持说，哪儿有信心，哪儿就有信心的果子。雅各和保罗完全同意，我
们得救唯独因着信，但信心从不孤独，它总有果子和好行为为伴。哪里有信心，
好行为就一定会追随到哪里。在这样的场景里，好行为是必须的。 
Faith is a matter of the heart. It is easy for anyone to say “I am a Christian” or “I 
have faith.” One can say it and still remain an unbeliever. Such a person is a 
hypocrite. But if there is faith, James insists, there will also be fruits of faith. James 
and Paul fully agree. We are saved by faith alone, but faith is never alone, without 
fruits, without good works. Where there is faith, good works will certainly follow. In 
that sense, good works are necessary. 
这种必须并不是出于强迫或威压。基督徒在恩典之下，而不在律法之下，“ 罪
必不能作你们的主，因你们不在律法之下，而是在恩典之下”（罗6:14）。我们
139 
之前说过，遵守上帝的旨意不是基督徒不得不做的事，而是他们想要做的事。好
行为不是他们“必须做，否则就会怎样”的事，而是他们为上帝在耶稣基督里的
恩典和慈爱，向他表达他们的喜乐。 
This necessity is not a matter of force, of coercion. The Christian is under grace, 
not under the law: “For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, 
but under grace” (Romans 6:14). We said previously that doing God’s will is not 
something Christians have to do, but something they want to do. Good works are 
not something they “must do or else” but the way they express their joy to the Lord 
for his grace and mercy in Christ Jesus. 
因为基督徒做好行为的必要性，从不是出于强迫，而是信心自然的结果。保
罗这样描述道： 
For the Christian the necessity to do good works is never forced, but a natural 
consequence of faith. Paul describes it this way: 
因为，上帝救众人的恩典已经显明出来，训练我们除去不敬虔的心和世俗的情欲，
在今世过克己、正直、敬虔的生活，等候福乐的盼望，并等候至大的上帝和我们
的救主 耶稣基督的荣耀显现。他为我们的缘故舍己，为了要赎我们脱离一切罪
恶，又洁净我们作他自己的子民，热心为善（多2:11-14）。 
The grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men. It teaches us to say 
“No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and 
godly lives in this present age, while we wait for the blessed hope—the glorious 
appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to 
redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very 
own, eager to do what is good (Titus 2:11-14). 
好行为对得救不是必须的 Good	works	not	necessary	for	
salvation	
“好行为是必须的”和“好行为对得救是必须的”，这两种陈述，存在着天
壤之别。前者是正确的，但后者，即使不是100%错误，也是极其危险的。虽然
140 
一个人有可能以正确的方式理解后面的陈述（信心没有行为是死的），它引进了
严重的混淆。这种陈述在教会中曾被错误的使用，因此，它是我们极力避免的。 
There is a world of difference between the two statements “good works are 
necessary” and “good works are necessary for salvation.” The former is correct, but 
the latter is dangerous, if not 100 percent wrong. Though one could possibly 
understand the latter statement in the correct way (faith without works is dead), it is 
open to serious misunderstanding. The statement has been erroneously used in the 
church and, therefore, is to be avoided. 
得救，自始至终，都是上帝的工作。律法揭露了人完全的无能，去为他自己
的得救做任何事。福音揭露了基督完美的价值和功绩，作为罪人的代替。在各各
他的十字架上，上帝受死的羔羊，向着所有的世代宣告，“成了”（约19:30）。
福音应许上帝在基督里宣称所有罪人为义。耶稣从死亡中复活，是上帝不可磨灭
的印记，证明他认可了他永恒儿子完美的赎价。 
Salvation, from beginning to end, is the work of God. The law reveals man’s 
utter inability to do anything for his own salvation. The gospel reveals the perfect 
worth and merit of Christ as the substitute for sinners. Upon Calvary’s cross the 
dying Lamb of God cried out to the ages, “It is finished” (John 19:30). The gospel 
promises that God has declared sinners righteous in Christ. Jesus’ resurrection from 
the dead is God’s indelible stamp of approval upon the perfect atonement of his 
eternal Son. 
基督的死亡和复活，普遍的称义，在上帝福音里的信心——所有的这些，都
在信徒生命中的好行为以先。好行为，作为信心的果子，始终跟随着信心。它们
从不优先于信心。 
Christ’s death and resurrection, universal justification, faith in God’s gospel—all 
this precedes good works in the life of the believer. Good works always follow faith 
as the fruit of faith. They never precede faith. 
这并不是说好行为是有害的。一些人，为了彻底的否决好行为是得救所必须
的，走得太远，以至于说好行为对信心是有害的。（这种观点被一个叫尼古拉斯·阿
姆斯多夫的路德宗牧师，在路德死后的时代所坚持。他的观点在协同式，最后的
141 
路德宗认信中被拒绝。）好行为能够对信心有害的唯一方式，是一个人开始把他
的信赖放在这些行为上。撒旦会一直试着让基督徒这样做，去为好行为而骄傲。
这错误并不在于好行为，而在于撒旦的诱惑，和人听从了撒旦的诱惑。 
This is not to say that good works are harmful. Some, in order to utterly 
discredit good works as necessary for salvation, have gone so far as to say that good 
works are harmful to faith. (Such a position was maintained by a Lutheran pastor 
named Nicholas Amsdorf in the years after Luther’s death. His position was rejected 
in the Formula of Concord, the last of the Lutheran Confessions.) The only way in 
which good works can become harmful to faith is if a person begins to put his or her 
trust in those works. Satan will always try to get the Christian to do just that, to take 
pride in good works. The fault is not in the works, but in Satan who tempts and in the 
person who listens to Satan. 
我们也不会说，恶行对信心并没有害处。声称如果好行为并不能帮助信心，
那么恶行也并不能损害信心，这可能很符合逻辑。或者声称恶行能损害信心，那
么好行为也一定能帮助信心，这看上去也很有道理。听起来很合理的可能并不符
合圣经。圣经，宣称一个人得救是通过信心而不是通过行为，同样宣称恶行总是
有害于信心：“亲爱的，你们是客旅，是寄居的，我劝你们要禁戒肉体的情欲；
这情欲是与灵魂争战的”（彼前2:11）。 
Nor are we saying that evil works are not harmful to faith. It may be good logic 
to say that if good works do not help faith then evil works do not destroy faith. It 
may also seem to make good sense to say that if evil works destroy faith then good 
works must help faith. What may sound reasonable is not scriptural. Scripture, which 
says that a person is saved by faith and not by works, also says that evil works are 
always harmful to faith: “Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the 
world, to abstain from sinful desires, which war against your soul” (1 Peter 2:11). 
唯独通过基督徒Only	by	the	Christian	
我们之前已经陈述过，只有基督徒能够有好行为。由于教会内部或外部的误
解，这种想法值得进一步思考。一个人可以从圣经谈论好行为特别的态度上，得
出结论，只有基督徒能够有好行为。圣经唯独鼓励与信心连接在一起的硕果：“所
142 
以，作为蒙慈爱的儿女，你们该效法上帝。要凭爱心行事，正如基督爱我们，为
我们舍了自己，当作馨香的供物和祭物献给上帝”（弗 5:1,2）。关于谁能够有
好行为，救主确定无疑的说道，“没有好树结坏果子，也没有坏树结好果子。每
一种树木可以从其果子看出来”（路 6:43,44）。没有在基督里的信心的人，是
不能结好果子的坏树。信徒是将会结出好果子的好树。 
It has been stated or suggested that only the Christian is able to do good works. 
Because of misunderstanding inside and outside the church, the thought deserves 
further consideration. One is able to conclude from the very manner in which 
Scripture speaks of good works that only the Christian can do them. It is only in 
connection with faith that Scripture encourages fruitfulness: “Be imitators of God, 
therefore, as dearly loved children and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and 
gave himself up for us” (Ephesians 5:1,2). The Savior leaves no doubt about who can 
do good works when he says, “No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear 
good fruit. Each tree is recognized by its own fruit” (Luke 6:43,44). The one who does 
not have faith in Christ is the bad tree that is unable to bear good fruit. The believer 
is the good tree that will bear good fruit. 
这并不是说，未悔改的人，不能够做些看上去很好的事，因此表面上符合上
帝的律法。不信的人可能很诚实、守信、真诚。他们可能是一个好公民和好邻居。
表面上他们可能在方方面面都遵守上帝的律法，但是这些行为并不能和基督徒的
好行为相混淆。 
This is not to say that the unregenerate are not able to do things that look good, 
and thus outwardly conform to God’s law. Unbelievers may be honest, trustworthy, 
truthful. They may be good citizens and make good neighbors. Outwardly they may 
conform to God’s law in many ways, but these works are not to be confused with the 
good works of the Christian. 
虽然人关注外表，上帝关注人的心（撒上16:7）。因此，上帝接纳亚伯的献
祭却拒绝该隐的献祭（创4；来11:4）。因为未悔改者的行为不来自于信心，他
们并不能让上帝喜悦和接纳。“没有信，就不能讨上帝的喜悦”（来11:6）。 
While man looks at the outward appearance, God looks at the heart (1 Samuel 
16:7). For that reason God accepted the offering of Abel but rejected the offering of 
143 
Cain (Genesis 4; Hebrews 11:4). Because the works of the unregenerate do not come 
from a heart of faith, they are not pleasing nor acceptable to God. “Without faith it is 
impossible to please God” (Hebrews 11:6). 
因此，教会将未重生者外在好的行动称为公民的义，或道德上的善，但不是
好行为。它们当然比恶习和犯罪更受人欢迎。它们可能拥有属世祝福的应许（太
6:5），但它们并不是圣经视角的好行为。它们至多只是“闪亮的恶习”。 
For that reason the church has referred to the outwardly good acts of the 
unregenerate as acts of civic righteousness, or acts that are ethically good, but not 
good works. They certainly are to be preferred to vices and crimes. They may have 
the promise of temporal blessings (Proverbs 14:34; Matthew 6:5), but they are not 
good works in the scriptural sense. They are at best only “glittering vices.” 
唯有基督徒能做的好行为，并不真的是他们“自己的”。它们是圣灵在基督
徒内心的工作。不，它们的发生，并不在基督徒以外，也没有违背他们的意愿；
圣经将好行为归给基督徒，但基督徒清楚地意识到，好行为的产生，并不能离开
信心，而信心，完全是上帝的工作。 
The good works that only Christians can do are not really their “own.” They are 
the work of the Holy Spirit in their hearts. No, they do not happen outside Christians 
nor against their will; Scripture credits them to Christians, but Christians are vitally 
aware that good works do not occur without faith, which is entirely the work of God. 
圣经甚至称基督徒在成圣的生命中与神同工（林前3:9；林后6:1），但离开
圣灵透过福音的工作，不会有信心的果子：“因为是上帝在你们心里运行，使你
们又立志又实行，为要成就他的美意”（腓2:13）。 
The Scriptures even speak of Christians cooperating in their lives of 
sanctification (1 Corinthians 3:9; 2 Corinthians 6:1), but there are no fruits of faith 
without the Holy Spirit working through the gospel: “For it is God who works in you 
to will and to act according to his good purpose” (Philippians 2:13). 
为了描述只有基督徒能够有好行为，考虑祷告的例子。未重生者能够执行祷
告的行动，并且大多数人曾经在某个时刻有过祷告。这个世界所有的宗教都以某
种方式鼓励祷告。面对以利亚的挑战，巴力的先知狂热的祷告，祈求他们的神能
144 
够降火到他们预备的祭物上（王上18:16-29）。然而，什么事都没有发生。他们
的祷告并没有得到回应。 
To illustrate that only the Christian is able to do a good work, consider the 
example of prayer. The unregenerate are able to perform the act of prayer, and most 
people pray at one time or another. All the religions of the world encourage prayer 
in one way or another. The prophets of Baal prayed feverishly that their god would 
send fire upon the sacrifice they had prepared at Elijah’s challenge (1 Kings 18:16-29). 
Nothing happened, however. Their prayer went unanswered. 
未重生者的祷告来自一颗不信的心；因此，他们的祷告没有回应。他们的祷
告总是基于罪，并不比法利赛人在圣殿里的祷告好：“上帝啊，我感谢你，我不
像别人勒索、不义、奸淫”（路18:11）。 
The prayers of the unregenerate come from a heart without faith; therefore, 
their prayers go unanswered. Their prayers are always sin, no better than the prayer 
of the Pharisee in the temple: “God, I thank you that I am not like other men” (Luke 
18:11). 
基督徒的祷告来自于信心。我们的主邀请基督徒去祷告，甚至要求他们去祷
告（诗50:15）。基督徒的祷告是上帝喜悦的。它们是好行为。上帝应许垂听和
回复圣徒的请求：“你们奉我的名无论求什么，我必成全，为了使父因儿子得荣
耀。你们若奉我的名向我求什么，我必成全”（约14:13,14）。 
The prayer of the Christian comes from a heart of faith. The Lord invites the 
Christian to pray, even commands him to do so (Psalm 50:15). The prayers of the 
Christian are pleasing to God. They are good works. God promises to hear and 
answer the requests of the saints: “I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that 
the Son may bring glory to the Father. You may ask me for anything in my name, and 
I will do it” (John 14:13,14). 
没有完全的成圣No	perfect	sanctification	
唯有基督徒能够去做好行为，但不是基督徒做的每一件事都是好行为。 
Only the Christian is able to do good works. But not everything the Christian 
does is a good work. 
145 
基督徒是新造的人：“我们是他所造之物，在基督耶稣里创造的，为要使我
们行善，就是上帝早已预备好要我们做的”（弗2:10）。圣灵住在基督徒的心里：
“如果上帝的灵住在你们里面，你们就不属肉体，而是属圣灵了”（罗8:9）。
基督徒被圣灵指引和带领。然而，基督徒并没有摆脱旧的本性。在一个人全部的
生命中，罪性紧紧地依附，干扰他的信心和好行为。旧的本性总是试图重占上风，
去享受犯罪的“自由”，就是它在罪人回转之前所享受的。 
The Christian is a new creature: “For we are God’s workmanship, created in 
Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do” 
(Ephesians 2:10). The Holy Spirit dwells within the Christian’s heart: “You, however, 
are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in 
you” (Romans 8:9). The Christian is guided and led by the Holy Spirit. Yet, the 
Christian is not without the old nature. During one’s entire life the sinful nature 
clings tightly, interfering in one’s life of faith and good works. The old nature always 
tries to regain the upper hand, to enjoy the “freedom” to sin that it enjoyed before 
the sinner’s conversion. 
结果，基督徒的生命是一场挣扎，这种挣扎贯穿人的一生。使徒保罗在罗马
书7章详细的描述了这种挣扎。他哀悼他基于新人想要做的善，他常常做不到，
罪性反对新人而带来的阻力是何等的凶猛。 
As a result, the life of the Christian is a struggle. It remains a struggle as long as 
one lives. The apostle Paul describes this at length in Romans 7. He laments that the 
good he wants to do according to the new man he does not always do, so fierce is 
the resistance waged by the sinful nature against the new man. 
因此，基督徒成圣的生命，是一个不断奋斗的过程。回转归信是一个瞬间的
动作。它发生在圣灵借着福音，在痛悔的罪人心里赐下信心的瞬间。称义，在上
帝面前成为义，并没有程度。基于上帝的恩典，在上帝眼里完全不义的罪人成为
完全的义人，他穿上了基督完美的义。但是成圣，是，并仍然是一个过程，一个
持续的逐步的成长。 
The Christian’s life of sanctification, therefore, is one of constant striving. 
Conversion—coming to faith—is a momentary act. It happens in that instant the 
Holy Spirit works faith in the heart of the contrite sinner by the gospel. Justification, 
146 
righteousness before God, knows no degrees. By God’s grace the wholly unrighteous 
sinner becomes wholly righteous in God’s sight, clothed in the perfect righteousness 
of Christ. But sanctification is and remains a process, a growing that is usually 
gradual. 
成圣是逐步的。值得盼望的是，它总是确定的，并且总是在成长，但是它永
远不会完全。基督徒依然同时是罪人和圣人——在上帝面前是公义和圣洁的，但
从来没有摆脱罪性，因此，也从来没有摆脱罪。好行为永远都是缺乏的。 
Sanctification is gradual. Hopefully it is always sure and always growing, but it is 
never perfect. The Christian remains both a sinner and a saint—holy and righteous 
before God, but never without the sinful nature and, therefore, never without sin. 
Good works are always lacking. 
基督徒的好行为在数量上总是很缺乏。某些时候基督徒可能缺乏理解。他可
能不能明确的知道一件事是对还是错（罗 14）。宣誓是罪吗？它总是罪吗？什
么时候它是罪？我面前的这件事，是否重要到可以用宣誓去担保呢？另一些时候，
基督徒可能缺乏遵守上帝旨意的热情（罗7:7-25）。比如，我知道我的财产并不
是我自己的，它们来自于上帝也属于上帝。我知道上帝想要我为他的荣耀和尊贵
去使用它们，但我不断的发现，去分享，去明智的使用我的财产，和为了福音的
事工慷慨地奉献，是何等的艰难。 
The Christian’s good works lack quantity. At one time the Christian may lack 
understanding. He or she may not know for certain whether a thing is right or wrong 
(Romans 14). Is it a sin to swear an oath? Is it always a sin? When isn’t it a sin? Is the 
matter under consideration serious enough to warrant swearing an oath? At other 
times the Christian may lack zeal to do God’s will (Romans 7:7-25). For example, I 
know that my possessions are not my own; they are from God and belong to him. I 
know that God wants me to use them to his glory and honor, but so often I find it 
difficult to share, to use my possessions wisely, and to give generously for the work 
of the gospel. 
基督徒的好行为在质量上同样很缺乏。上帝想要基督徒的生命完全地投入到
事奉中：“所以，弟兄们，我以上帝的慈悲劝你们，将身体献上当作活祭，是圣
147 
洁的，是上帝所喜悦的，你们如此事奉乃是理所当然的”（罗12:1）。但基督徒
同时是新人和旧人，同时是圣人和罪人。他或她做的每一件事依然被罪所污染。
什么时候基督徒对他邻舍的慈善行为，是完全自发的，没有一点骄傲的念头，没
有一丝微弱的，想要得到上帝回报或他人赞赏的想法？没有任何行为单单出于新
人。在上帝眼里，行为是好的，并不是因为它们是完全的，而是因为基督从罪里
洁净了我们，也洁净了我们的行为。 
The Christian’s good works also lack quality. God wants the life of the Christian 
to be spent entirely in his service: “Offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and 
pleasing to God—this is your spiritual act of worship” (Romans 12:1). But the 
Christian is both new and old, both a saint and a sinner. Everything he or she does is 
still tainted by sin. When is the Christian’s act of charity toward his or her neighbor 
entirely spontaneous, without a hint of pride, without some faint thought of 
receiving a return from God or approval by others? No work is ever the result only of 
the new man. Works are good in the sight of God, not because they are perfect, but 
because of Christ who has cleansed us—and our works—from sin. 
唯有福音的动机Only	gospel	motivation	
基督徒能够并且想要有好行为。上帝从与基督，那棵葡萄树，连接着的枝子
上寻找果子（约15:1-8）。基督徒在他们成圣的生命中彼此激励。但唯有一个动
机能讨神的喜悦——福音。在基督徒生命中督促着他们的，不是律法，而是福音。 
Christians are able to do good works and want to do them. God seeks fruits 
from the branches that are attached to Christ, the vine (John 15:1-8). Christians are 
to encourage one another in their lives of sanctification. But only one motivation is 
pleasing to God—the gospel. Christians are compelled in their lives, not by the law, 
but by the gospel. 
这不是说，律法不会产生外在的效果。罗马天主教会，拥有巨大的教堂，无
价的艺术收藏品，广泛的地产和数不清的财富，这都是律法能够做到什么的证据。
摩门教被称为今天增长最快的宗教。它不是基督教，而是一个异端，完全被律法
驱使，这是以律法为动机能够做到什么的一个极好的例子。律法，伴随着它的强
148 
迫，威胁，因骄傲和自义的吸引，产生了外在的行动。但是没有一个结果，能够
被上帝接纳。 
It is not that the law does not produce outward results. The Roman Catholic 
Church, with its huge cathedrals, priceless art collections, extensive real estate, and 
vast wealth, is evidence of what the law can accomplish. Mormonism is called the 
fastest growing religion today. It is not Christian, but a cult, driven entirely by the 
works of the law, and is the prime example of what a motivator the law can be. The 
law, with its coercion, threats, and appeal to pride and self-righteousness, produces 
outward acts. But none of its results is acceptable to God. 
基督徒已经从律法中得自由了。他们不再在律法以下。把律法作为动机，将
使上帝自由的儿女重新回到律法的重担和威胁之下。基督徒成圣生命中的动机，
永远是福音：“我们爱，因为上帝先爱我们”（约一4:19）。为什么我想要服事
上帝，为他而活，遵守他的旨意，富有好行为？我的动机，并不是盼望得到回报，
也不是因为刑罚的强迫或威胁。而是因为基督，为我死在各各他的十字架上，永
远废除了我所有罪的愧疚和咒诅。 
Christians have been freed from the law. They are no longer under law. Law as a 
motivator would place God’s free children back under the yoke and threats of the 
law. The motivation for Christians in their lives of sanctification is always to be the 
gospel: “We love because he first loved us” (1 John 4:19). Why do I want to serve my 
God, live for him, do his will, abound in good works? It is not with hope of repayment, 
not because of force or the threat of punishment. It is because Christ died for me on 
Calvary’s cross and removed forever the guilt and curse of all my sins. 
这不是说，律法在基督徒成圣的生命中，没有地位。正如我们在之前的章节
中提到的，律法作为指引服务于基督徒的生命。基督徒将不会跟随着自己选择的
行为或其他人的标准。上帝的律法是唯一绝对可靠的指引。上帝的律法是他对我
生命的旨意。我将寻求它，并且唯独寻求它的指引。 
It is not that the law has no place in the Christian’s life of sanctification. As we 
noted in the previous chapter, the law serves as a rule or guide for Christian living. 
The Christian will not follow self-chosen works or the standards of other people. 
149 
God’s law is the only infallible guide. God’s law is his will for my life. I will seek it and 
no other guide. 
在圣经谈到的两座圣山上，都可以观察到，上帝的律法和福音，在基督徒成
圣的生命中，适当的位置。第一座是西奈山。上帝亲自在这座山上显现，为了将
他律法的话语赐给他的子民。在上帝宣告律法，去指导他们在荒漠里的旅程，和
他们在迦南地的生活之前，他提供了遵守他旨意的动机：“我是耶和华—你的上
帝，曾将你从埃及地为奴之家领出来”（出20:2）。第二座山是各各他山。在那
里，上帝永恒的儿子，为了拯救罪人摆脱罪和撒旦的奴役，并释放他们，在他的
国度里服事他们的主，在罪恶和羞辱的十字架上伸开了双臂。每座山都教导，在
基督徒成圣的生命中，来自于福音的正确动机。 
The proper place of God’s law and gospel in the Christian’s life of sanctification 
may be observed at both of the holy mountains of which Scripture speaks. The first is 
Mount Sinai. God himself appeared on the mountain in order to give his people the 
words of his law. Before God spoke a single word of law to guide his people during 
the journey through the desert and their life in Canaan, he provided the motivation 
for doing his will: “I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the 
land of slavery” (Exodus 20:2). The other mountain is Calvary. There God’s eternal 
Son stretched out his arms on the cross of guilt and shame in order to rescue sinners 
from the slavery of sin and Satan and free them to serve their Lord in his kingdom. 
Each mountain teaches the proper motivation of the gospel in the Christian’s life of 
sanctification. 
在你下一次阅读保罗书信的时候，留意这个属灵的使徒，当他鼓励他的读者，
活出一个基督徒的生命时，他怎样使用福音作为动机。“弟兄们，你们蒙召是要
得自由；只是不可把这自由当作放纵情欲的机会，总要用爱心互相服侍”（加
5:13）。“所以，作为蒙慈爱的儿女，你们该效法上帝。要凭爱心行事，正如基
督爱我们，为我们舍了自己，当作馨香的供物和祭物献给上帝”（弗 5:1,2）。
“因为，上帝救众人的恩典已经显明出来，训练我们除去不敬虔的心和世俗的情
欲，在今世过克己、正直、敬虔的生活”（多2:11,12）。 
The next time you are reading from Paul’s epistles, note how the inspired 
apostle uses the gospel to motivate his readers when he encourages them in their 
150 
Christian living: “You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not use your 
freedom to indulge the sinful nature; rather, serve one another in love” (Galatians 
5:13). “Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children and live a life of love, 
just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice 
to God” (Ephesians 5:1,2). “For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared 
to all men. It teaches us to say ‘No’ to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live 
self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age” (Titus 2:11,12). 
称义第一Justification	first	
为了恰当的理解好行为，一个人必须知道称义和成圣恰当的关系。正确的教
导和理解，一个教义和另一个教义之间的关系，是重要的，并且没有比称义和成
圣之间的关系，更加重要的了。这两者是密不可分的。哪里有称义，那里就有成
圣；哪里有成圣，那里就有称义。它们都是基本的真理，它们总是形影不离。但
是它们存在明确的顺序。逻辑上，称义在成圣以先，成圣跟随着称义。 
For a proper understanding of good works, one must know the proper 
relationship of justification and sanctification. The relationship of one doctrine to 
another is important for correct teaching and understanding, and none is more 
important than the relationship between justification and sanctification. The two are 
inseparable. Where there is justification, there will also be sanctification. Where 
there is sanctification, there is also justification. Both are fundamental; they are 
inseparable. But there is a definite order. Logically, justification precedes 
sanctification. Sanctification follows justification. 
称义的信心，接受了在上帝的家庭里，成为上帝被收养的孩子——后嗣的身
份。这信心是一种新生，使我们从罪的奴役中被拯救出来。它将我们变成新造的
人和天堂的后嗣。“等到时候成熟，上帝就差遣他的儿子，为女子所生，且生在
律法之下，为要把律法之下的人赎出来，使我们获得儿子的名分。……可见，你
不再是奴隶，而是儿子了，既然是儿子，就靠着上帝也成为后嗣了”（加4:4,5,7）。 
Justifying faith receives the status of adoption as sons, heirs in God’s family. 
This faith is the new birth, which rescues from the bondage of sin. It makes a person 
a new creature and an heir of heaven. “When the time had fully come, God sent his 
151 
Son, born of a woman, born under law, to redeem those under law, that we might 
receive the full rights of sons. So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you 
are a son, God has made you also an heir” (Galatians 4:4,5,7). 
同时，称义的信心表明它本身在爱里面：“凡信耶稣是基督的，都是从上帝
生的；凡爱生他之上帝的，也必爱从上帝生的 。我们爱上帝，又实行 他的命
令，由此就知道我们爱上帝的儿女了。我们遵守上帝的命令，这就是爱他了，而
且他的命令并不是难守的”（约一5:1-3）。 
At the same time, justifying faith manifests itself in love: “Everyone who 
believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father 
loves his child as well. This is how we know that we love the children of God: by 
loving God and carrying out his commands. This is love for God: to obey his 
commands. And his commands are not burdensome” (1 John 5:1-3). 
这两条教义适当的关系，对信心是生死攸关的。罗马天主教将称义和成圣混
为一谈，剥夺了基督徒救恩的保证。救恩成了一个人必须挣得的东西或借着行为
而有的功德。一旦一个人自己的行为对救恩是必须的，他一定会活在对饶恕的怀
疑中。一个人永远不知道他或她做的是否已经足够了。事实上，没有人能够做到
“足够”。没有人能够透过做必须要做的工作，在上帝面前成为义。在罗马天主
教里，好行为成了一种让人们保持一致的俱乐部，而不是上帝完全自由的儿女，
喜乐的回应。 
The proper relationship of these two doctrines is vital for faith. Roman 
Catholicism confuses justification with sanctification and robs Christians of the 
surety of their salvation. Salvation then becomes something one must earn or merit 
by works. As long as one’s own working is necessary for salvation, one must live in 
doubt of forgiveness. One never knows when he or she has done enough. The fact is, 
no one can do enough. No one can even begin to do the works necessary to be 
found righteous before God. In Roman Catholicism good works become a kind of 
club to keep people in line rather than the joyful response of the fully free child of 
God. 
152 
改革宗神学倾向于调和称义和成圣，他们声称成圣和称义一样，是救恩的本
质。罪的赦免对救恩很重要，而成圣的生命也是如此。“好行为是必须的”变成
了“好行为对救恩是必须的”。 
Reformed theology tends to coordinate justification and sanctification by saying 
that sanctification as well as justification are essential for salvation, that forgiveness 
of sins is important for salvation but so is the life of sanctification. “Good works are 
necessary” becomes “good works are necessary for salvation.” 
至少，改革宗神学以称义为代价去强调成圣。基督徒的生命优先于基督的生
命和死亡。基督的生命，作为一个榜样，优先于基督的生命和死亡，作为罪人的
代替。称义的目标和意图，变成了一个成圣的生命，而不是罪的赦免和救恩的保
证。道德重建放在了首先的位置；称义成为了事后的东西。信心成为了一种对上
帝的道德承诺和委身，而代替了称义的信心和罪得赦免的位置。 
At the very least, Reformed theology stresses sanctification at the expense of 
justification. The Christian’s life takes precedence over Christ’s life and death. 
Christ’s life as the Christian example takes precedence over Christ’s life and death as 
the sinner’s substitute. The goal and purpose of justification becomes a sanctified life 
instead of forgiveness of sins and the assurance of salvation. Moral regeneration 
takes first place; justification becomes an afterthought. In the place of justifying faith 
and forgiveness of sin, faith becomes a kind of moral commitment to God. 
这种对称义和成圣的调和，和以称义为代价去强调成圣，都留下了它们的印
记。对律法与福音忠信的宣讲，让位于获奖感言般的见证和个人承诺。可悲的是，
这种影响正在进入路德宗的圈子。福音不再是唯一的动力。其结果并不是无关紧
要的。基督徒被拽回律法的奴役之下。基督徒的自由丢失了。好行为的喜乐，更
多的变成了一种不堪忍受的重担。 
The coordination of justification and sanctification, as well as the stress placed 
on sanctification at the expense of justification, leave their mark. Faithful preaching 
of law and gospel gives way to testimonials and personal commitment. Sadly, this 
influence is finding its way into Lutheran circles. The gospel is no longer the single 
motivator. The result is not insignificant. The Christian is dragged back beneath the 
153 
bondage of the law. Christian freedom is lost. The joyfulness of good works becomes 
more of a burden to be borne. 
迎战怀疑Against	doubt	
对称义和成圣的混淆，就像对律法和福音的任何混淆一样，只会导致怀疑，
而怀疑，是基督教信仰彻底的异常。基督教是一个最为置信的宗教。甚至律法，
当恰当的使用它时，并不会使人陷入怀疑。律法清晰的宣布，罪人都是失丧的。
他们因违背了上帝的律法——全部的律法，而犯了罪。他们是该死的。他们将会
下地狱。这不是一种可能，而是一个事实。福音尤其不会产生怀疑。救恩是来自
上帝的礼物。基督为罪人——所有的罪人，死了。相信上帝福音的人，不是希望
他们得救；而是知道他们已经得救。他们确信他们的救恩和永恒的生命。 
Confusion of justification and sanctification, like any confusion between law and 
gospel, only leads to doubt, and doubt is entirely uncharacteristic of Christian faith. 
Christianity is a religion of greatest confidence. Even the law, properly used, does not 
leave one in doubt. The law says clearly that sinners are lost. They are guilty of 
breaking God’s law—all of it. They are damned. They are going to hell. It is not a 
possibility; it is a reality. The gospel especially leaves no doubt. Salvation is a gift of 
God. Christ died for sinners—all of them. Sinners who believe God’s gospel do not 
hope they are saved; they know they are saved. They are certain of salvation and 
eternal life. 
路德宗关注于忠心的教导上帝的话语——律法和福音，称义和成圣，以避免
基督徒重新回到怀疑和恐惧中。为了说明仔细地和适当地谈论好行为的必要性，
我们注意下面几种陈述： 
The Lutheran concern in teaching God’s Word faithfully —law and gospel, 
justification and sanctification—is that Christians are not turned back to doubt and 
fear. We note a few statements that illustrate this need for concern always to speak 
carefully and properly about good works: 
l 基督徒总是很快乐，谦卑，热心于祷告，宽宏大量，满足； 
l 基督徒从不会伤心，愤怒，忧虑或抱怨； 
l 活出一个好行为的生命很容易； 
154 
l 基督徒想要去做好行为，因为上帝告诉他们要这样做； 
l 登山宝训是圣经中最伟大的讲道 
l Christians are always cheerful, humble, fervent in prayer, forgiving, 
content. 
l Christians are never sad, never get angry, never worry or complain. 
l Living a life of good works is easy. 
l Christians want to do good works because God tells them to. 
l The Sermon on the Mount is the greatest sermon in the Bible. 
如果基督徒只有新人，前三条陈述就会是对的。但基督徒同样有罪性。基督
徒的生命是一场挣扎。除此之外，它们导致基督徒怀疑自己是否是基督徒。第四
条陈述，暗示着律法，而不是福音，是好行为的动机。至于第五条陈述，登山宝
训基本上是一个律法，而不是福音的讲道，它教导了很多律法，却对痛悔的罪人
提供了很少的安慰。 
The first three statements would be true if Christians had only the new man. 
But Christians also have the sinful nature. Living a Christian life is a struggle. To 
suggest otherwise leads Christians to doubt that they are Christians. The fourth 
statement suggests that the law instead of the gospel is the motivation for good 
works. As for the last statement, the Sermon on the Mount is basically a law sermon, 
not gospel. It teaches much about law, but offers little comfort for contrite sinners. 
结论Conclusion	
“路德宗不教导好行为”，这种控告怎么样？“路德宗并不知道怎样去教导
好行为”，这种类似的控告又怎么样？它们都不公平。更好的说法是，路德宗对
于他们教导好行为的方式，十分谨慎。 
What about the charge “Lutherans don’t teach good works”? What about a 
similar charge, “Lutherans don’t know how to teach good works”? Both are unfair. It 
would be far better to say that Lutherans are very careful about the way they teach 
good works. 
155 
路德宗所相信和教导的，需要追溯到圣经中律法和福音重要的区别那里。律
法是好的，但律法不能提供拯救。律法是基督徒生命中的指引，但它不产生去做
好行为的渴望或力量。 
What Lutherans believe and teach goes back to Scripture’s vital distinction 
between law and gospel. The law is good, but the law cannot save. The law is a guide 
for Christian living, but it cannot give the desire or strength to do good works. 
唯独福音提供拯救。它宣告了透过基督完美的生命和无辜的血而来的义。它
释放罪人摆脱律法的威胁和愤怒。它授予了新生。唯独它在基督徒生命中产生力
量。 
The gospel alone saves. It proclaims justification through the perfect life and 
innocent blood of Christ. It frees sinners from the threats and wrath of the law. It 
imparts new life. It creates a sincere interest in doing God’s will. It alone gives 
strength for Christian living.
